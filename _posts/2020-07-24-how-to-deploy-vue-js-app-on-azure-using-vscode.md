Deploying Vue.JS App made easy using an extension available on Visual Studio Code. In this blog, I'll guide you on how to create your app service on Azure where you will be able to deploy your Vue.JS app in that instance.

### FTF (First Things First)

- Make sure you have an Azure Subscription to continue. If you don't have a subscription, you can register your own free trial here <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/" target="_blank">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/</a>
- Visual Studio Code installed, of course amigo.
- Vue.JS Application
- A cup of coffee or tea â˜• (Optional)

### 1. Create Your Azure App Service

1.1 Go to the <a href="https://portal.azure.com" target="_blank">https://portal.azure.com</a> and search for "App Services" on the search box. Choose the "Create app service" or click the "Add" button.

In this sample, I'm using Free F1 but, you can choose other plans depending on your preferred machine specifications.

1.3 Review and click "Create" when you're done. Wait until it's done then you can view your app service overview like the image below.

### 3. Deploying your Vue.JS App
3.1 Build first your app using `npm run build` command and wait until it finishes.
3.2 Click the Azure Extension logo on the left side and Sign In your Azure Account. This will open a browser tab where you should login your microsoft account with Azure Subscription.

3.4.b Browse the "dist" folder then select it.
